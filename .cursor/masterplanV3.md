# 3D Print System Project Plan (Rebuild for Small Lab)

## 1. Project Overview
This project will rebuild a Flask-based 3D print job management system, specifically tailored for an academic/makerspace setting operating as an **extremely small lab with at most two employees working as a duo, often on the same computer using a single, shared password**. The system will handle the workflow from student submission to completion, with file tracking, staff approval, and the ability to open the exact uploaded files directly in local applications.

> **Note:** While the system is primarily designed for a single staff computer, it fully supports operation on up to two lab computers, provided both have access to the same shared network storage and PostgreSQL database. All staff-facing features, file operations, and protocol handler integration are compatible with this two-computer setup.

The project aims to replace potentially ad-hoc or manual 3D print request systems with a **centralized, digitally managed, and workflow-driven platform.** It prioritizes clarity, efficiency, accurate file tracking, and a **strong, non-fragile foundation**, especially addressing the complexities of file changes introduced by slicer software and ensuring resilience. It leverages **modularity, explicit event-driven workflow management, asynchronous processing, and resilient data handling** to improve the experience for both students and the minimal staff managing the service.

## 2. Core Features & Requirements

### 2.1 Core Features
1.  **Student submission process**: Allow students to upload 3D model files (.stl, .obj, .3mf) with metadata (name, email, print parameters).
2.  **Staff approval workflow**: Enable staff to review, slice files, and approve/reject jobs.
3.  **Enhanced operational dashboard**: Real-time auto-updating interface with comprehensive staff alerting:
    *   **Auto-updating data**: Dashboard refreshes automatically without manual intervention
    *   **Sound notifications**: Audio alerts when new jobs are uploaded to notify staff immediately  
    *   **Visual alert indicators**: Persistent "NEW" badges and highlighting for unreviewed jobs until acknowledged
    *   **Job age tracking**: Display time elapsed since job submission with color-coded prioritization
4.  **Multi-computer support**: System can run on up to two staff computers, as long as both use the same shared storage and database.
5.  **File lifecycle management**: Track original files; manage authoritative files post-slicing; embed `metadata.json` with files for resilience.
6.  **Job status tracking & Event Logging**: Clear progression through Uploaded → Pending → ReadyToPrint → Printing → Completed → PaidPickedUp, and Rejected, with an **immutable event log** tracking all changes.
7.  **Email notifications**: **Asynchronously** send automated updates to students.
8.  **Thumbnails**: **Asynchronously** generate previews from uploaded files. If thumbnail generation fails, no thumbnail will be displayed, or a generic placeholder may be shown.

### 2.2 Technical Requirements
-   **Backend**: **Modular Flask (Blueprints)** with SQLAlchemy (**PostgreSQL**).
-   **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS with professional card-style UI design. Alpine.js optional for advanced interactivity.
-   **Enhanced Dashboard Features**: 
    *   **Auto-updating system**: JavaScript polling with lightweight JSON API endpoints for real-time data refresh
    *   **Audio notifications**: Browser Audio API integration with user preference controls and sound file management
    *   **Visual alert system**: CSS animations and highlighting for unreviewed job indicators with persistent state tracking
    *   **Time tracking utilities**: Helper functions for human-readable time elapsed display with color-coded aging thresholds
-   **Task Queue**: Celery or RQ for **asynchronous processing** (emails, thumbnails).
-   **Authentication**: Simple staff-wide shared password (for the single computer duo) with session management.
-   **File handling**: Shared network storage (mounted at OS level) with standardized naming, status-based directory structure, and embedded `metadata.json`.
-   **Direct file opening**: Custom protocol handler to open local files in slicer software.
-   **Email**: Flask-Mail with Office 365 SMTP integration.
-   **Database**: **PostgreSQL** with Flask-Migrate for schema management.
-   **Time Display**: All timestamps displayed in Central Time (America/Chicago) with automatic DST handling.
-   **Pricing Model**: Weight-only pricing ($0.10/gram filament, $0.20/gram resin) with $3.00 minimum charge.
-   **Time Input**: Hour-based time inputs with conservative rounding (always round UP to nearest 0.5 hours).
-   **Critical Dependencies**:
    - Flask-WTF for form handling and CSRF protection
    - WTForms with EmailValidator, DataRequired, Length validators
    - email-validator>=2.0.0 (essential for form validation)
    - pytz>=2023.3 (required for timezone handling)
    - Celery/RQ dependencies.
    - **UI Dependencies**:
        - Tailwind CSS 3.x (for Apple-style design system)
        - Alpine.js 3.x (for dynamic form behavior and dashboard interactivity)
        - PostCSS 8.x (for Tailwind processing)
    - **System Dependencies**:
        - ImageMagick (for thumbnail generation)
        - wkhtmltopdf (for future PDF features)

### 2.3 Simplified Architecture Principles
This project will adhere to simplicity where appropriate, but prioritize robustness:
1.  **Authentication**: Single shared staff password for dashboard access on the designated computer.
2.  **Models**: Essential `Job` model, plus an **`Event` model** for logging.
3.  **File Management**: Straightforward folder structure, accessible via shared network, with `metadata.json` alongside files.
4.  **Routes**: Core functionality (using **Blueprints**) for submission, approval, and status updates, triggering **events**.
5.  **Testing**: Focus on basic functionality, file handling, and workflow events.

### 2.4 User Experience Requirements
Based on operational needs, the following UX features are critical:
-   **Dynamic Form Behavior**: Color selection must be disabled until print method is selected, with contextual help text
-   **Progressive Disclosure**: Print method descriptions should be clearly visible to guide material choice
-   **Input Validation**: Real-time client-side validation with visual feedback to prevent submission errors
-   **Educational Content**: Comprehensive introduction text with liability disclaimers and scaling guidance
-   **Accessibility**: Visual error states with red borders, clear error messages, and error scrolling for form submission
-   **File Validation**: Immediate feedback on file selection with size and type checking
-   **Enhanced Operational Dashboard UX**:
    *   **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard data refreshes automatically every 45 seconds without user intervention
    *   **Audio Feedback**: Sound notifications play when new jobs are uploaded, with user-controlled toggle
    *   **Visual Alert System**: Unreviewed jobs display prominent "NEW" badges with pulsing highlight borders until acknowledged
    *   **Temporal Awareness**: Job age display with human-readable format ("2d 4h ago") and color-coded prioritization
    *   **Staff Acknowledgment**: Clear "Mark as Reviewed" functionality to manage alert states
    *   **Last Updated Indicator**: Timestamp showing when dashboard data was last refreshed
-   **Mobile and Accessibility Considerations**: 
    - Ensure the submission form and dashboard are fully functional and readable on mobile devices.
    - Test UI components with screen readers for basic WCAG 2.1 compliance.
    - Ensure keyboard-only navigation works for all modals and interactive elements.
-   **Apple UI/UX Compliance**:
    - All UI components must follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines
    - Use 8pt spacing grid system
    - Implement proper depth and translucency effects
    - Support Dynamic Type and reduced motion
    - Maintain minimum touch target size (44x44pt)
    - Use system font stack (SF Pro / system-ui)
    - Follow Apple's color palette guidelines


#### 2.4.1 Required Submission Form Introduction Text

**The following text must appear at the top of the student submission form, unaltered:**

> Before submitting your model for 3D printing, please ensure you have thoroughly reviewed our Additive Manufacturing Moodle page, read all the guides, and checked the checklist. If necessary, revisit and fix your model before submission. Your model must be scaled and simplified appropriately, often requiring a second version specifically optimized for 3D printing. We will not print models that are broken, messy, or too large. Your model must follow the rules and constraints of the machine. We will not fix or scale your model as we do not know your specific needs or project requirements. We print exactly what you send us; if the scale is wrong or you are unsatisfied with the product, it is your responsibility. We will gladly print another model for you at an additional cost. We are only responsible for print failures due to issues under our control.

### 3.2 Data Model
```python
# Using PostgreSQL for robustness
from datetime import datetime
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Job(db.Model):
   id = db.Column(db.String, primary_key=True)   # uuid4 hex
   student_name = db.Column(db.String(100))
   student_email = db.Column(db.String(100))
   discipline = db.Column(db.String(50))
   class_number = db.Column(db.String(50))
   original_filename = db.Column(db.String(256))
   display_name = db.Column(db.String(256))  # Standardized name used in dashboard and filenames
   file_path = db.Column(db.String(512))         # Path to authoritative file
   metadata_path = db.Column(db.String(512))     # Path to metadata.json
   status = db.Column(db.String(50))
   printer = db.Column(db.String(64))
   color = db.Column(db.String(32))
   material = db.Column(db.String(32))
   weight_g = db.Column(db.Float)
   time_hours = db.Column(db.Float)
   cost_usd = db.Column(db.Numeric(6, 2))
   acknowledged_minimum_charge = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
   student_confirmed = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
   student_confirmed_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)
   confirm_token = db.Column(db.String(128), nullable=True, unique=True)
   confirm_token_expires = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)
   reject_reasons = db.Column(db.JSON, nullable=True)
   staff_viewed_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)  # For tracking unreviewed jobs and visual alerts
   created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
   updated_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)
   last_updated_by = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=True)
   notes = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)  # Staff/internal notes for this job
   events = db.relationship('Event', backref='job', lazy=True) # Relationship to Event

class Event(db.Model):
   id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
   job_id = db.Column(db.String, db.ForeignKey('job.id'), nullable=False)
   timestamp = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
   event_type = db.Column(db.String(50)) # e.g., 'JobCreated', 'StaffApproved', 'EmailSent'
   details = db.Column(db.JSON, nullable=True) # Contextual info
   triggered_by = db.Column(db.String(50)) # 'student', 'staff', 'system'
```

### 3.3 Authentication Approach
**Staff Authentication**: Session-based login using a single, shared staff password defined in the application configuration, intended for the duo operating on the single staff computer. Access to dashboard and administrative functions is protected. This is accepted due to the specific lab context.
**Student Confirmation**: Token-based mechanism using itsdangerous.
**Accountability**: While individual staff actions aren't tracked via login, the Event model provides an immutable audit trail of system actions and status changes.

### 3.4 Comprehensive Job Lifecycle (Event-Driven)

**Note on metadata.json:** A metadata.json file, containing key job details, will be created alongside the original upload and updated as needed. This file travels with the 3D model, ensuring data resilience.

**Note on Original File Preservation:** Throughout the job lifecycle, the original file uploaded by the student (and referenced by job.original_filename) will be preserved in its initial storage location (e.g., within the storage/Uploaded/ directory). This file will not be moved or deleted when staff create a sliced version that becomes the authoritative job.file_path for printing. The original uploaded file will only be removed according to the Data Retention Policy (see Section 5.7), ensuring it remains available for historical reference or if re-slicing is needed.

**Standardized File Naming Convention:** FirstAndLastName_PrintMethod_Color_SimpleJobID.original_extension

#### 1. Uploaded
* **Trigger:** Student successfully submits the print job form. JobCreated event triggered.
* **File Operations:**
  * Original uploaded file is validated (type, size).
  * File is renamed according to the standardized convention.
  * Stored in storage/Uploaded/JaneDoe_Filament_Blue_123.stl.
  * metadata.json created in storage/Uploaded/.
  * job.file_path points to this location. job.original_filename stores the student's initial filename. job.display_name stores the standardized name. job.metadata_path is set.
  * **Note:** `display_name` is always set to the filename generated by the standardized naming convention function (see Section 6.6). Whenever the authoritative filename changes (e.g., after slicing), `display_name` is updated to match the new filename. This ensures consistency between the database and the actual file on disk.
  * Asynchronous task (GenerateThumbnail) triggered and stored in storage/thumbnails/.
* **Key Actions:** System processes submission, logs event.
* **Email Notification:** None typically, student sees a success page.

**Student Submission UI/UX (Corresponds to 'Uploaded' Status)**
    **Page Flow**:
        `Public Access (/submit)` → `Upload Form Page` → `POST to /submit` → `File Validation & Job Creation` → `Success Page (/submit/success?job=<id>)` OR `Upload Form Page with Errors`
 **Upload Form (`/submit`)**:
  **Form Introduction**: Comprehensive warning text at the top of the form stating:
    "Before submitting your model for 3D printing, please ensure you have thoroughly reviewed our Additive Manufacturing Moodle page, read all the guides, and checked the checklist. If necessary, revisit and fix your model before submission. Your model must be scaled and simplified appropriately, often requiring a second version specifically optimized for 3D printing. We will not print models that are broken, messy, or too large. Your model must follow the rules and constraints of the machine. We will not fix or scale your model as we do not know your specific needs or project requirements. We print exactly what you send us; if the scale is wrong or you are unsatisfied with the product, it is your responsibility. We will gladly print another model for you at an additional cost. We are only responsible for print failures due to issues under our control."

    * Color Preference (dynamic dropdown, disabled until Print Method selected, required):
      - Filament Colors (23 options): True Red, True Orange, Light Orange, True Yellow, Dark Yellow, Lime Green, Green, Forest Green, Blue, Electric Blue, Midnight Purple, Light Purple, Clear, True White, Gray, True Black, Brown, Copper, Bronze, True Silver, True Gold, Glow in the Dark, Color Changing
      - Resin Colors (4 options): Black, White, Gray, Clear
    * Printer Dimensions (informational section only, no user input): Displays complete scaling guidance with text: "Will your model fit on our printers? Please check the dimensions (W x D x H): Filament - Prusa MK4S: 9.84" × 8.3" × 8.6" (250 × 210 × 220 mm), Prusa XL: 14.17" × 14.17" × 14.17" (360 × 360 × 360 mm), Raise3D Pro 2 Plus: 12" × 12" × 23.8" (305 × 305 × 605 mm). Resin - Formlabs Form 3: 5.7 × 5.7 × 7.3 inches (145 x 145 x 175 mm). Ensure your model's dimensions are within the specified limits for the printer you plan to use. If your model is too large, consider scaling it down or splitting it into parts. For more guidance, refer to the design guides on our Moodle page or ask for assistance in person. If exporting as .STL or .OBJ you MUST scale it down in millimeters BEFORE exporting. If you do not the scale will not work correctly."

- Job Detail View/Modal: All job metadata, editable fields, calculated cost, full event history, staff notes (editable notes section for staff/internal use), admin override controls

**Administrative Controls & Manual Overrides UI/UX**
- Status override controls, file management controls, email control during overrides, other admin actions
- Notes Management: Staff can add/edit notes for any job. All changes are saved and visible to staff only.

**Fallback/Manual Processes for Pending Status:**
- If a student doesn't confirm within the token expiry period, staff are alerted (e.g., via dashboard).
- Staff can manually resend a confirmation email (generating a new token).
- Staff can manually mark a job as confirmed if email confirmation fails (e.g., student confirms verbally). This action is logged.

**UI/UX Implementation Notes:**
- All status changes must provide immediate visual feedback
- Use Apple-style loading indicators for async operations
- Implement smooth transitions between states
- Provide clear error states with recovery options
- Use consistent iconography across all status indicators
- Follow Apple's animation timing guidelines

## 4. Technical Deep Dive: Direct File Access

> **Note:** All actions listed below automatically trigger an entry in the `Event` log as described in Section 3.2 and 3.4.

### 4.1 Single-Computer Architecture & Resilient Storage
1. **Shared File Storage:**
   - All job files stored on a network share.
   - This share must be mounted at the OS level on the single staff computer running the Flask app, ensuring a consistent path (e.g., Z:\3DPrintFiles\ or /mnt/3dprint_files).
   - The Flask app references files using this path.
   - metadata.json files reside alongside job files, providing resilient metadata handling.

> **Multi-Computer Operation:**
> The system supports running the Flask application on up to two staff computers. Both computers must mount the shared storage at the same path (e.g., both use Z:\storage\ or both use /mnt/3dprint_files/), and both must be able to connect to the same PostgreSQL database. The custom protocol handler (SlicerOpener) must be installed and registered on both computers. Path consistency is critical for correct file access and protocol handler operation.

2. **Database Strategy (PostgreSQL Recommended):**
   - Chosen Approach: The system will use PostgreSQL. The Flask application will run on the single, designated staff computer, acting as the server.
   - Rationale: While SQLite is simpler, PostgreSQL offers superior concurrency, data integrity, and scalability, even in a small lab. This provides a significantly more robust and non-fragile backend, preventing potential locking issues or data corruption, especially with asynchronous tasks or multiple browser sessions accessing the system. It's a foundational choice for long-term resilience.
   - The PostgreSQL server can run on the same staff computer or a dedicated server if available.

### 4.2 Custom Protocol Handler
- A custom URL protocol (e.g., 3dprint://) will be registered on the single staff computer.
- Example URL: 3dprint://open?path=Z:\storage\Uploaded\JaneDoe_Filament_Blue_123.stl

### 4.3 File Opening Solution
1.  **Custom Protocol Registration (Windows Example)**:
    ```
    Windows Registry:
    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\3dprint\shell\open\command
    (Default) = "C:\Path\To\SlicerOpener.exe" "%1"
    ```
    (A `.bat` or `.reg` file can automate this setup on staff machines).
2.  **Helper Application (`SlicerOpener.py`)**:
    *   A small Python script (compiled to `.exe` using PyInstaller).
    *   Takes the `3dprint://` URL as an argument.
    *   Parses the file path from the URL.
    *   **Crucially, it must perform robust security validation:**
        *   The extracted file path must be normalized and converted to an absolute path.
        *   It must be verified to be strictly within the `AUTHORITATIVE_STORAGE_BASE_PATH` to prevent path traversal or access to unauthorized locations.
        *   The script should log all validation attempts and their outcomes.
    *   **User-Facing Error Handling:**
        *   The script must provide clear, user-friendly error messages (e.g., via simple GUI dialogs using a library like `tkinter.messagebox` if compiled) for issues such as:
            *   Invalid or missing file path in the URL.
            *   Security validation failure.
            *   File not found at the specified path.
            *   Slicer executable not found or failed to launch.
            *   Other exceptions during file opening.
    *   **Logging:**
        *   The script should perform local file logging for auditing and troubleshooting. Logs should include:
            *   Timestamp of the request.
            *   The full `3dprint://` URI received.
            *   Result of security validation.
            *   Success or failure of opening the file.
            *   Any errors encountered.
    *   Launches the appropriate slicer software, passing the validated file path to it.
    *   (Future enhancement: Could check file extension to open in different slicers).

            show_error_popup("Opening Error", error_msg)
            log_message(error_msg) # Log to a file for troubleshooting
    ```

3.  **Web Dashboard Integration**:
    *   The "Open File" button in the dashboard generates the `3dprint://` link dynamically using `job.file_path`.
    ```html
    <a href="3dprint://open?path={{ job.file_path|urlencode }}">Open in Slicer</a>
    ```

### 4.4 SlicerOpener.py Protocol Handler: Functions, Security, and Integration
- **Purpose and User Story:** Enables staff to open 3D print job files directly from the web dashboard in their local slicer software with a single click.
- **Security Validation:**
  - Only files within explicitly authorized storage directories (e.g., storage/Uploaded/, storage/ReadyToPrint/, etc.) are permitted.
  - The handler resolves all paths to absolute form and checks that they are descendants of the allowed directories.
  - Path traversal attempts (e.g., ..\, ../) and symbolic link exploits are blocked.
  - Attempts to access system directories (e.g., C:\Windows\System32) or network shares are denied.
  - All security validation failures are logged and result in a clear error message (console or GUI dialog).
- **File Existence and Slicer Detection:**
  - The handler checks that the requested file exists before attempting to open it.
  - Supported file types include .stl, .3mf, .obj, .ply, .amf, .step, .stp.
  - The handler detects installed slicer software (PrusaSlicer, UltiMaker Cura, Bambu Studio, Orca Slicer) by searching standard installation paths.
  - The file is opened in the first available compatible slicer, with preference order configurable.
  - If no slicer is found, an error is reported.
- **Logging and Audit Trail:**
  - All file access attempts (successes and failures) are logged to a rotating log file (tools/logs/slicer_opener.log).
  - Log entries include timestamp, requested URL, resolved file path, validation result, and action taken.
  - Security violations, file errors, and slicer launch results are all recorded for audit and troubleshooting.
- **Error Handling:**
  - All errors (security, file not found, slicer not found, URL parsing) are reported in the console output.
  - Planned enhancement: Use tkinter to display user-friendly GUI dialogs for all error and success conditions, ensuring staff receive clear feedback even outside the console.
- **Integration with Web Dashboard:**
  - The dashboard generates a 3dprint://open?file=<urlencoded_path> link for each job's authoritative file.
  - The "Open File" button is shown for jobs in appropriate statuses (e.g., ReadyToPrint, Printing).
  - Clicking the button launches the protocol handler, which validates and opens the file in the slicer.
  - Fallback instructions are provided if the protocol handler is not installed.
- **Protocol Registration and Deployment:**
  - A Windows registry file and/or batch installer is provided to register the 3dprint:// protocol on staff computers.
  - The protocol handler is deployed to all staff machines that need to open files.
  - Installation documentation covers setup, troubleshooting, and security considerations.
- **Testing and Validation:**
  - Automated and manual tests cover all security validation, file existence, and slicer detection scenarios.
  - All access attempts are verified in the log file for auditability.
  - End-to-end workflow is tested from dashboard to slicer launch.
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Implement GUI error dialogs for all error and success conditions.
  - Add cross-platform support (e.g., macOS/Linux) if needed.
  - Enhance error handling for edge cases and improve timeout behavior.
  - Integrate with advanced dashboard features (e.g., job detail modals, admin overrides).

## 5. Operational Considerations

### 5.1 Implementation Phases
1. Basic Structure: Flask app (Blueprints), DB setup (PostgreSQL), core Job & Event models.
2. Shared Infrastructure: Setup shared network storage (mounted), DB server setup.
3. Task Queue Setup: Integrate Celery or RQ and configure workers.
4. Student Submission: Implement public form, validation, file saving (with metadata.json), JobCreated event, async thumbnail task.
5. Staff Dashboard (View Only): Basic staff login, display jobs from DB, view event logs.
6. Staff Approval/Rejection: Implement modals, backend logic (events, tasks), file moves.
7. Student Confirmation: Token generation, confirmation page, StudentConfirmed event, file moves.
8. Printing Workflow: Implement "Mark Printing", "Mark Complete", "Mark Picked Up" events and file movements.
9. Custom Protocol Handler: Develop and test SlicerOpener.py (with security, error handling, logging) and registry setup. Integrate "Open File" button.
10. UI Polish: Refine dashboard UI with Alpine.js, implement thumbnails.
11. Admin Controls: Implement manual override features (with event logging).
12. Metrics & Reporting: Add basic reporting features.
13. Testing & Refinement: Comprehensive testing throughout all phases.
14. CI/CD and Code Quality:
- Set up automated testing (unit + integration tests) using `pytest` or similar.
- Configure a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI) to run linting, tests, and deploy on push.
- Enforce formatting with tools like `black`, `isort`, and `flake8`.
- Future enhancement: deploy to server (or localhost) using `docker-compose` with environment variable support.


### 5.2 Security Considerations
- Secure file upload handling (type validation, secure_filename, size limits).
- Time-limited, cryptographically signed tokens for student confirmation.
- Staff password storage (if using a more complex auth in future) should use strong hashing (e.g., bcrypt via passlib). For shared password, store securely in config.
- CSRF protection for all forms (Flask-WTF).
- Ensure network share has appropriate read/write permissions for the app server, but restricted for general users.
- Validate all file paths before use to prevent path traversal attacks.
- Regularly update dependencies.
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.

#### Logging and Retention:
- All application logs, including protocol handler access logs and error logs, should be stored with rotation enabled (e.g., using `RotatingFileHandler`).
- Logs should be retained for at least 90 days, or according to university data policies.

### 5.3 Deployment Considerations
1. Network Setup: As per section 4.1.1 (Mounted share).
2. Application Deployment:
   - Flask application runs on the single staff computer using a production-ready WSGI server (e.g., Waitress, Gunicorn).
   - PostgreSQL server must be running and accessible.
   - Task queue workers (e.g., Celery) must be running as separate processes.
   - Other computers access the web interface via browser.
   - Protocol handler (SlicerOpener.exe) must be deployed on the staff computer.
   - Flask application can be run on one or both staff computers, as long as both use the same shared storage and database.
   - Protocol handler (SlicerOpener.exe) must be deployed and registered on both staff computers.
   - Path consistency for the shared storage is required on both computers.
3. Path Consistency: Critical. Use mounted paths.
4. Basic Error Logging: Configure logging.
5. Email Deliverability: Handle SPF/DKIM.

#### Health Monitoring:
- Implement a basic health check route (`/healthz`) returning 200 OK for load balancer or uptime monitoring.
- Monitor storage space and email delivery failures via logs or alert thresholds.

### 5.4 University Network Considerations
- Firewalls: May block custom protocols or outgoing connections for the helper app. Liaise with IT.
- Server Restrictions: University IT may have policies against running persistent servers or specific ports.
- Admin Rights: Registering protocol handlers or installing software might require admin rights. The helper app can be deployed to user-space if packaged correctly.
- Storage Quotas: Be mindful of file sizes and implement cleanup if quotas are restrictive.
- Alternative File Access: If custom protocol is unfeasible, a fallback could be instructing staff to copy a displayed network path, or a less ideal "download and open".

### 5.5 Cost Matrix & Calculation
- Filament Print Cost: $0.10 per gram.
- Resin Print Cost: $0.20 per gram.
- $3.00 minimum charge for all print jobs.
- The system enforces the minimum charge and calculates cost based on material and weight.

### 5.6 Metrics & Reporting
- Usage statistics: submission counts, trends, printer utilization.
- Reporting interface: (future) CSV/Excel export, filterable views, basic charts.

### 5.7 Data Retention and Cleanup Policy
- Retention Period: Job data and associated files for jobs in a final state (Completed, PaidPickedUp, or Rejected) will be retained for 90 days from the date the job reached that final status.
- Cleanup Process: Initially, cleanup will be a manual process. Staff will be responsible for periodically identifying and deleting jobs and their associated files that are older than the retention period.
- Active Jobs: Jobs in Uploaded, Pending, ReadyToPrint, or Printing statuses are considered active and are not subject to this cleanup policy until they reach a final state.
- Future Enhancement: Automated cleanup scripts or features are considered a future enhancement, not part of the initial simple system.

### 5.8 Backup and Disaster Recovery
- PostgreSQL Database: Use standard PostgreSQL backup tools (e.g., pg_dump) to create regular (e.g., weekly) database dumps. Store these backups securely in a separate location.
- File Storage (storage/ directory): Manually copy the storage/ directory or rely on IT-managed backups if the network share is covered.

## 6. Implementation Blueprints and Proven Patterns

### 6.1 Dashboard UI/UX Architecture

#### 6.1.1 Card-Style Tab Interface
**Recommended Design**: Single-row card-based tabs with modern styling
**Implementation**: 
```html
<!-- Successful Tab Design Pattern -->
<div class="flex space-x-1 mb-6 overflow-x-auto">
    {% for tab_status, config in tabs.items() %}
    <a href="{{ url_for('dashboard.index', status=tab_status) }}" 
       class="tab-card {% if current_status == tab_status %}active{% endif %}">
        <div class="flex items-center justify-between">
            <span class="font-medium">{{ config.title }}</span>
            <span class="badge">{{ stats[config.stat_key] }}</span>
        </div>
    </a>
    {% endfor %}
</div>
```

**CSS Success Pattern (Critical Styling)**:
```css
.tab-card {
    @apply bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm border border-gray-200 px-4 py-3 min-w-0 flex-shrink-0 
           text-blue-600 hover:shadow-md hover:bg-blue-50 transition-all duration-200;
}
.tab-card.active {
    @apply bg-blue-600 text-white shadow-md;
}
.badge {
    @apply bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 text-xs font-semibold px-2 py-1 rounded-full ml-2;
}
.tab-card.active .badge {
    @apply bg-blue-500 text-white;
}
```

**Key Success Factors**:
- Rounded corners (0.75rem) for modern appearance
- Box shadows for depth perception
- Blue color scheme (#2563eb) for consistency
- Count badges for immediate status visibility
- Hover animations for interactivity
- Overflow handling for responsive design

#### 6.1.2 Information Architecture (Redundancy Elimination)
**Critical Decision**: Remove all redundant information display
**Implementation Pattern**:
- **NO redundant tab titles** when already in that tab context
- **NO status badges** when they match the current tab
- **NO status descriptions** like "4 jobs in this status" when count is in badge
- **Student name as primary heading** instead of filename
- **File display name as secondary** information

**Template Pattern (Anti-Redundancy)**:
```html
<!-- Job Display - Clean Information Hierarchy -->
<div class="job-item">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">{{ job.student_name }}</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">{{ job.display_name }}</p>
    {% if job.status != current_status %}
        <span class="status-badge">{{ job.status }}</span>
    {% endif %}
    <!-- Material and cost shown only when available and relevant -->
    {% if job.material and job.cost_usd %}
        <div class="text-sm text-gray-500">
            {{ job.material | capitalize }} - ${{ "%.2f"|format(job.cost_usd) }}
        </div>
    {% endif %}
</div>
```

### 6.2 Display Formatting System (Essential for Professional Appearance)
**File**: `app/utils/helpers.py`
**Critical Success Pattern**:
```python
def format_printer_name(printer_name):
    """Convert database printer names to display format"""
    printer_map = {
        'prusa_mk4s': 'Prusa MK4S',
        'prusa_xl': 'Prusa XL', 
        'raise3d_pro2plus': 'Raise3D Pro 2 Plus',
        'formlabs_form3': 'Formlabs Form 3'
    }
    return printer_map.get(printer_name.lower(), printer_name)

def format_color_name(color_name):
    """Convert database color names to display format"""
    color_map = {
        'true_red': 'True Red',
        'glow_in_dark': 'Glow in the Dark',
        'color_changing': 'Color Changing',
        # ... complete mapping
    }
    return color_map.get(color_name.lower(), color_name.replace('_', ' ').title())

def format_discipline_name(discipline):
    """Convert database discipline to proper display format"""
    discipline_map = {
        'landscape_architecture': 'Landscape Architecture',
        'interior_design': 'Interior Design',
        'hobby_personal': 'Hobby/Personal'
    }
    return discipline_map.get(discipline.lower(), discipline)
```

**Flask App Registration (CRITICAL)**:
```python
# In app/__init__.py
from app.utils.helpers import format_printer_name, format_color_name, format_discipline_name

def create_app(config_name=None):
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    # Register template filters (ESSENTIAL)
    app.jinja_env.filters['printer_name'] = format_printer_name
    app.jinja_env.filters['color_name'] = format_color_name  
    app.jinja_env.filters['discipline_name'] = format_discipline_name
    
    return app
```

### 6.3 Timezone Implementation (Central Time Display)
**Requirement**: Display all times in Central Time (America/Chicago) with automatic DST handling
**Dependencies**: `pytz>=2023.3` in requirements.txt

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
# app/utils/helpers.py
import pytz
from datetime import datetime

def to_local_datetime(utc_datetime):
    """Convert UTC datetime to Central Time"""
    if utc_datetime is None:
        return None
    
    utc = pytz.UTC
    central = pytz.timezone('America/Chicago')
    
    if utc_datetime.tzinfo is None:
        utc_datetime = utc.localize(utc_datetime)
    
    return utc_datetime.astimezone(central)

def format_local_datetime(utc_datetime):
    """Format datetime in Central Time as MM/DD/YYYY at HH:MM AM/PM"""
    local_dt = to_local_datetime(utc_datetime)
    if local_dt is None:
        return 'N/A'
    return local_dt.strftime('%m/%d/%Y at %I:%M %p')

def detailed_local_datetime(utc_datetime):
    """Detailed format with timezone abbreviation"""
    local_dt = to_local_datetime(utc_datetime)
    if local_dt is None:
        return 'N/A'
    return local_dt.strftime('%m/%d/%Y at %I:%M %p %Z')
```

**Template Filters (CRITICAL)**:
```python
# Flask app registration
app.jinja_env.filters['local_datetime'] = format_local_datetime
app.jinja_env.filters['detailed_datetime'] = detailed_local_datetime
```

**Template Usage**:
```html
<span class="text-gray-500 text-sm">{{ job.created_at | local_datetime }}</span>
```

### 6.4 Dashboard Route Architecture (Complete Implementation)
**File**: `app/routes/dashboard.py`
**Success Pattern**:
```python
@dashboard.route('/')
@login_required
def index():
    """Main dashboard with status parameter routing"""
    status = request.args.get('status', 'UPLOADED').upper()
    valid_statuses = ['UPLOADED', 'PENDING', 'READYTOPRINT', 'PRINTING', 'COMPLETED', 'PAIDPICKEDUP', 'REJECTED']
    
    if status not in valid_statuses:
        status = 'UPLOADED'
    
    try:
        # Get jobs for selected status
        jobs = Job.query.filter_by(status=status).order_by(Job.created_at.desc()).all()
        
        # Calculate statistics for all tabs
        stats = {
            'uploaded': Job.query.filter_by(status='UPLOADED').count(),
            'pending': Job.query.filter_by(status='PENDING').count(),
            'ready': Job.query.filter_by(status='READYTOPRINT').count(),
            'printing': Job.query.filter_by(status='PRINTING').count(),
            'completed': Job.query.filter_by(status='COMPLETED').count(),
            'paidpickedup': Job.query.filter_by(status='PAIDPICKEDUP').count(),
            'rejected': Job.query.filter_by(status='REJECTED').count()
        }
        
        return render_template('dashboard/index.html', 
                             jobs=jobs, stats=stats, current_status=status)
    except Exception as e:
        current_app.logger.error(f"Error loading dashboard: {str(e)}")

### 6.11 Student Confirmation Workflow (PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION)

**Status**: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED - EXCEPTIONAL SUCCESS

The student confirmation workflow represents a critical bridge in the 3D printing service, enabling secure, user-friendly job confirmation that seamlessly transitions approved jobs into the printing queue. This implementation demonstrates robust token-based security, professional UI/UX design, and reliable file management.

#### 6.11.1 Confirmation System Architecture (PROVEN DESIGN)

**Token-Based Security Pattern**:
```python
# app/utils/tokens.py - SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION
def generate_confirmation_token(job_id: str, expires_hours: int = 168) -> tuple[str, datetime]:
    """Generate secure confirmation token with 7-day expiration"""
    serializer = URLSafeTimedSerializer(current_app.config['SECRET_KEY'])
    token = serializer.dumps(job_id, salt='job-confirmation')
    expiration = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=expires_hours)
    return token, expiration

def confirm_token(token: str, max_age_hours: int = 168) -> str:
    """Validate token with cryptographic verification"""
    serializer = URLSafeTimedSerializer(current_app.config['SECRET_KEY'])
    try:
        job_id = serializer.loads(token, salt='job-confirmation', max_age=max_age_hours * 3600)
        return job_id
    except Exception:
        return None  # Invalid/expired token
```

**Security Features**:
- **Cryptographic Signing**: Uses `itsdangerous` with SECRET_KEY for tamper-proof tokens
- **Time-Limited Validity**: 7-day expiration prevents indefinite token usage
- **Job-Specific Tokens**: Each token tied to specific job ID for precise access control
- **Salt Protection**: Additional security layer prevents token prediction

@main.route('/confirm/<token>', methods=['POST'])
def confirm_job_post(token):
    """Process job confirmation with robust validation"""
    
    # Multi-layer token validation
    job_id = confirm_token(token)
    if not job_id:
        flash('Invalid or expired confirmation link.', 'error')
        return redirect(url_for('main.index'))
    
    # Job existence and state validation
    job = Job.query.filter_by(id=job_id).first()
    if not job or job.status != 'PENDING':
        flash('This job cannot be confirmed.', 'error')
        return redirect(url_for('main.index'))
    
    # Additional security checks
    if job.confirm_token != token or \
       (job.confirm_token_expires and job.confirm_token_expires < datetime.utcnow()):
        flash('Invalid or expired confirmation link.', 'error')
        return redirect(url_for('main.index'))
    
    try:
        # Atomic file movement and database update
        new_file_path = FileService.move_file_between_status_dirs(
            current_path=job.file_path,
            from_status='PENDING',
            to_status='READYTOPRINT'
        )
        
        # Database transaction
        job.status = 'READYTOPRINT'
        job.student_confirmed = True
        job.student_confirmed_at = datetime.utcnow()
        job.file_path = new_file_path
        job.last_updated_by = 'student'
        
        db.session.commit()
        
        # Success logging and user feedback
        current_app.logger.info(f"Job {job.id[:8]} confirmed by student {job.student_email}")
        return render_template('main/confirm_success.html', title='Job Confirmed', job=job)
        
    except Exception as e:
        current_app.logger.error(f"Error confirming job {job.id[:8]}: {str(e)}")
        db.session.rollback()
        flash('An error occurred while confirming your job. Please contact us.', 'error')
        return redirect(url_for('main.confirm_job', token=token))
```

**Validation Layers**:
1. **Token Cryptographic Validation**: Signature and expiration verification
2. **Job Existence Check**: Ensures job exists in database
3. **Status Validation**: Confirms job is in PENDING state
4. **Token Matching**: Verifies token belongs to specific job
5. **Expiration Double-Check**: Additional expiration validation

#### 6.11.5 File Management Integration (SEAMLESS OPERATION)

**Method**: `move_file_between_status_dirs()`

```python
@staticmethod
def move_file_between_status_dirs(current_path: str, from_status: str, to_status: str) -> str:
    """Move file between status directories with comprehensive error handling"""
    
    # Extract filename and construct new path
    filename = os.path.basename(current_path)
    storage_root = current_app.config.get('APP_STORAGE_ROOT')
    new_dir = os.path.join(storage_root, to_status)
    new_path = os.path.join(new_dir, filename)
    
    # Ensure target directory exists
    os.makedirs(new_dir, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Atomic file movement with comprehensive error handling
    try:
        if os.path.exists(current_path):
            os.rename(current_path, new_path)
            return new_path
        else:
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"Source file not found: {current_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        raise OSError(f"Failed to move file: {str(e)}")
```

**File Movement Workflow**:

#### 3.5.5 JavaScript Template Literal Integration

**Challenge**: Maintain component consistency in dynamically generated content

**Solution**: Enhanced JavaScript functions to generate HTML matching component structure

```javascript
function createJobCardHtml(job, currentStatus) {
    // Generate HTML that matches _job_card.html component structure
    const isUnreviewed = !job.staff_viewed_at;
    const newBadge = isUnreviewed ? `
        <div class="flex items-center mb-4">
            <span class="new-badge px-3 py-1 text-xs rounded-full">NEW</span>
        </div>
    ` : '';
    
    return `
        <div class="job-card ${isUnreviewed ? 'unreviewed-job' : ''}" data-job-id="${job.id}">
            <div class="p-6">
                ${newBadge}
                <!-- Content matches server-side component exactly -->
            </div>
        </div>
    `;
}
```

**Quality Assurance**:
- JavaScript-generated content matches server-side components exactly
- All dynamic functionality preserved (auto-refresh, modal interactions)
- Template literals updated whenever components are modified
- Consistent styling between initial load and dynamic updates

#### 3.5.6 Component Development Best Practices

**Naming Conventions**:
- **Private components**: Prefix with underscore (`_component_name.html`)
- **Descriptive names**: Clear indication of component purpose
- **Consistent patterns**: Similar components follow same naming structure

**File Organization**:
- **Component grouping**: Related components in same directory
- **Logical hierarchy**: Components organized by feature area
- **Clear ownership**: Components clearly associated with specific template sections

**Documentation Standards**:
- **Component purpose**: Clear description of component functionality
- **Input parameters**: Document required context variables
- **Usage examples**: Show proper include statements and context
- **Dependencies**: Note any required CSS classes or JavaScript functions

**Reusability Guidelines**:
- **Single responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Minimal dependencies**: Components work with minimal external requirements
- **Flexible parameters**: Components accept relevant context variables
- **Consistent styling**: Components follow established design patterns

#### 3.5.7 Template Include Pattern Standards

**Context Preservation**:
```html
<!-- Automatic context passing -->
{% include 'path/to/component.html' %}

<!-- Explicit context passing -->
{% include 'path/to/component.html' with context %}

<!-- Specific variable passing -->
{% include 'path/to/component.html' with job=job, status=current_status %}
```

**Error Prevention**:
- All include paths validated during template reorganization
- Context variables documented for each component
- Template inheritance properly maintained through reorganization
- Base template paths updated consistently across all templates

#### 3.5.8 Route Integration and Path Updates

**Systematic Updates**: All Flask route files updated to use new template paths

**Route Update Pattern**:
```python
# Before reorganization
return render_template('main/submit.html')
return render_template('dashboard/index.html')

# After reorganization  
return render_template('student/submission/submit.html')
return render_template('staff/dashboard/index.html')
```

**Quality Assurance**:
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All render_template calls updated (7 total across 2 files)
- **Path validation**: New paths tested for correctness
- **Functionality preservation**: Zero breaking changes during transition
- **Documentation**: Path changes documented in version control

#### 3.5.9 Implementation Statistics and Metrics

- **Dependencies Tracking**: Monitor component interdependencies
- **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure modularization doesn't impact rendering speed

**Future Enhancement Pathways**:
- **Email Templates**: Modularize notification emails using established patterns
- **Error Pages**: Create consistent error page components
- **Public Pages**: Develop public-facing page components
- **Advanced Components**: Create macro libraries for complex reusable elements

**Version Control Standards**:
- **Atomic Commits**: Component changes committed with clear descriptions
- **Documentation Updates**: Template changes reflected in masterplan documentation
- **Testing Requirements**: Component modifications include functionality verification
- **Migration Planning**: Major template changes planned and communicated

#### 3.5.11 Technical Implementation Lessons

**Critical Success Factors**:
1. **Systematic Approach**: Template reorganization requires methodical execution
2. **Route Synchronization**: All template path updates must be comprehensive
3. **Context Preservation**: Include statements must properly pass required variables
4. **Component Testing**: Each component must be verified independently and integrated
5. **JavaScript Consistency**: Dynamic content generation must match component structure

**Avoided Pitfalls**:
- **Breaking Changes**: Maintained 100% functionality throughout reorganization
- **Path Inconsistencies**: Systematic approach prevented missing template updates
- **Context Loss**: Proper include patterns prevented variable scoping issues
- **Performance Degradation**: Modular loading maintains original rendering speed
- **Documentation Gaps**: Comprehensive documentation prevents future confusion
