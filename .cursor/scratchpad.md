# 3D Print System Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

This project will rebuild a Flask-based 3D print job management system, specifically tailored for an academic/makerspace setting operating as an **extremely small lab with at most two employees working as a duo, often on the same computer using a single, shared password**. The system will handle the workflow from student submission to completion, with file tracking, staff approval, and the ability to open the exact uploaded files directly in local applications.

The project aims to replace potentially ad-hoc or manual 3D print request systems with a **centralized, digitally managed, and workflow-driven platform.** It prioritizes clarity, efficiency, accurate file tracking, and a **strong, non-fragile foundation**, especially addressing the complexities of file changes introduced by slicer software and ensuring resilience. It leverages **modularity, explicit event-driven workflow management, asynchronous processing, and resilient data handling** to improve the experience for both students and the minimal staff managing the service.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

Based on the `masterplanV3.md`, key challenges and areas requiring careful attention include:

1.  **Robust File Management**: Ensuring the integrity and correct tracking of files through various stages (upload, slicing, storage) is critical. The use of `metadata.json` and a clear directory structure is a good approach. Standardized file naming will also be important.
2.  **Event-Driven Workflow**: Implementing an immutable event log for all job status changes and actions will be central to the system's reliability and auditability.
3.  **Asynchronous Task Handling**: Correctly setting up and managing asynchronous tasks (e.g., for email notifications, thumbnail generation) using Celery or RQ is crucial for performance and responsiveness.
4.  **Apple-Style User Experience (UX)**: All frontend development must strictly adhere to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and design philosophy, following the principles documented in our UI reference guides:
    - Clarity: Prioritize legibility, white space, and intuitive layouts
    - Deference: Let content lead; avoid flashy UI elements
    - Depth: Use translucent panels and subtle shadows (max 3 layers)
    - Consistency: Maintain standardized patterns throughout
    - Simplicity: Strip to essential elements
    - Efficiency: Optimize interaction paths
    - Accessibility: Support Dynamic Type, high contrast, and reduced motion
5.  **Database Design and Interaction**: Proper setup of PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy models (`Job`, `Event`), and migrations is fundamental.
6.  **Direct File Opening**: Implementing the custom protocol handler for opening files in local slicer software will require careful OS-level integration.
7.  **Modularity**: Adhering to the planned modular structure using Flask Blueprints will be important for maintainability.
8.  **Error Handling and Resilience**: The system needs to be robust against common issues, especially around file operations and external service integrations (e.g., email).
9.  **Security**: While authentication is simplified (shared password), ensuring protection against common web vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS) is still necessary, likely via Flask-WTF.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Summary of Executor Actions (Today):**

- Completed the static layout and visual hierarchy redesign of the /submit form. This included:
  - Changing the intro box to a yellow warning/info box with "Important:" heading.
  - Grouping related fields and adding more vertical spacing and whitespace.
  - Styling the printer dimensions as a gray info box.
  - Making the submit button full-width, blue, and rounded.
- Implemented dynamic field behavior using Alpine.js:
  - The "Color Preference" dropdown is disabled until a print method is selected.
  - Only the relevant color options (filament or resin) are shown based on the selected print method.
  - Contextual help text appears under both the print method and color fields.
- Updated the Project Status Board to reflect:
  - [x] Redesign the Form Layout and Visual Hierarchy for /submit (static HTML/CSS only)
  - [x] Implement Dynamic Field Behavior (color dropdown disables/enables and options update based on print method)
  - [ ] Enhance Client-side Validation and Error Feedback (next step, not started)
- Prepared to implement client-side validation and error feedback (real-time validation, error highlighting, error scrolling, file type/size feedback), but paused as requested.

**Status:**
- The /submit form now closely matches the required UI/UX in both static layout and dynamic field behavior. Ready to continue with validation and error feedback next session.

## Lessons

*   PowerShell `mkdir` might have limitations with multiple arguments or very long path arguments compared to `bash`. Create directories individually or in smaller batches if issues arise.
*   Always verify directory/file creation steps, e.g., using `list_dir`, especially if terminal output is unusual or truncated.
*   All frontend development must reference and comply with the Apple UI Design Research document and UI Reference Guide. These documents serve as the foundation for our UI/UX implementation.
