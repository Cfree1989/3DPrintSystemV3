# 3D Print System V3 Development Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Rebuilding a Flask-based 3D print job management system for an academic/makerspace setting operating as an **extremely small lab with at most two employees working as a duo, often on the same computer using a single, shared password**. The system handles workflow from student submission to completion, with file tracking, staff approval, and the ability to open uploaded files directly in local applications.

**Core Objectives:**
1. **Student submission process**: Upload 3D model files (.stl, .obj, .3mf) with metadata
2. **Staff approval workflow**: Review, slice files, approve/reject jobs  
3. **Enhanced operational dashboard**: Real-time auto-updating interface with audio notifications and visual alerts
4. **File lifecycle management**: Track original files; manage authoritative files post-slicing; embed metadata.json
5. **Job status tracking & Event Logging**: Clear progression through status workflow with immutable event log
6. **Email notifications**: Asynchronously send automated updates to students
7. **Direct file opening**: Custom protocol handler to open local files in slicer software

**Target Environment**: System can run on up to two staff computers, as long as both use the same shared storage and database.

**UPDATED CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS**

The runtime testing revealed that our Phase 0 cleanup was successful but **insufficient**. While we eliminated code confusion and fixed template inheritance, we have **critical infrastructure gaps** that prevent the application from functioning:

1. **Database Infrastructure Missing**: No database initialization, no environment configuration
2. **Template System Partially Broken**: Modal components had incorrect macro definitions
3. **Testing Approach Inadequate**: Our tests only verified file structure, not runtime functionality

**REVISED PROJECT SCOPE**: We need an emergency **Phase 0.5: Infrastructure Recovery** before proceeding to Phase 1.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Architecture Requirements
- **Backend**: Modular Flask (Blueprints) with SQLAlchemy (PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS with professional card-style UI, Alpine.js for interactivity  
- **Task Queue**: Celery or RQ for asynchronous processing (emails, thumbnails)
- **Authentication**: Simple staff-wide shared password with session management
- **File Storage**: Shared network storage with standardized naming and status-based directory structure
- **Email**: Flask-Mail with Office 365 SMTP integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Flask-Migrate for schema management
- **Time Display**: Central Time (America/Chicago) with automatic DST handling
- **Pricing**: Weight-based ($0.10/gram filament, $0.20/gram resin, $3.00 minimum)

### Critical Dependencies
- Flask-WTF for form handling and CSRF protection
- WTForms with EmailValidator, DataRequired, Length validators
- email-validator>=2.0.0 (essential for form validation)
- pytz>=2023.3 (required for timezone handling)
- Celery/RQ dependencies for async processing
- ImageMagick (for thumbnail generation)

### File System Dependencies and Issues (NEW ANALYSIS - Dec 2024)
**Comprehensive dependency analysis completed - identified cleanup opportunities:**

**Active System Architecture:**
- **Entry Point**: `app.py` ‚Üí `app/__init__.py` (app factory pattern working correctly)
- **Active Blueprints**: `main.py` (student routes), `dashboard.py` (staff routes) - both properly registered
- **Template Inheritance**: `base/base.html` serves as root for all active templates
- **Modular Components**: Student submission (8 components), staff dashboard (7 components) - all actively used
- **Static Assets**: Core CSS (`style.css`, `v0dev-animations.css`) and sound files properly referenced

**Critical Issues Identified:**
1. **Broken Template Reference**: `test/validation_test.html` extends `"base.html"` instead of `"base/base.html"`
2. **Unregistered Blueprint**: `app/routes/test.py` exists but not registered in app factory
3. **Missing Error Handlers**: Error templates (404, 500, generic) exist but no `@app.errorhandler` decorators registered
4. **Orphaned Static Files**: `static/css/input.css` and `static/js/validation.js` not referenced anywhere

### Job Lifecycle (Event-Driven)
1. **Uploaded**: Student submits ‚Üí file stored, metadata.json created, thumbnail task queued
2. **Pending**: Staff approves ‚Üí confirmation email sent, awaiting student confirmation
3. **Rejected**: Staff rejects ‚Üí rejection email sent with reasons
4. **ReadyToPrint**: Student confirms ‚Üí file moved to print queue
5. **Printing**: Staff marks as printing ‚Üí job in progress
6. **Completed**: Staff marks complete ‚Üí completion email sent
7. **PaidPickedUp**: Student collects ‚Üí final state

### üö® CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS IDENTIFIED

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:

**Issue 1: Database Schema Mismatch**
- **Technical Root Cause**: Database tables don't exist or are out of sync with SQLAlchemy models
- **Business Impact**: Dashboard completely non-functional, 500 errors on all job queries
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Application unusable
- **Evidence**: `psycopg2.errors.UndefinedColumn: column job.discipline does not exist`

**Issue 2: Template Macro Architecture Flaw**
- **Technical Root Cause**: Base modal template not properly defined as Jinja2 macro
- **Business Impact**: All dashboard modals fail to render
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Core UI components broken
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED by Executor (converted to proper macro)

**Issue 3: Environment Configuration Missing**
- **Technical Root Cause**: No .env file with database credentials and app secrets
- **Business Impact**: Application cannot start with proper configuration
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Deployment impossible

### üîß INFRASTRUCTURE ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS

**Database Strategy Decision Required**:
- **Option A**: PostgreSQL (production-ready, matches psycopg2 errors)
- **Option B**: SQLite (development-friendly, simpler setup)
- **Recommendation**: Start with SQLite for immediate recovery, PostgreSQL for production

**Configuration Management**:
- Need `.env` file with required variables: `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `STAFF_PASSWORD`
- Flask config validation requires these variables to start
