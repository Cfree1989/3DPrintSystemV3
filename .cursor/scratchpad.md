# 3D Print System V3 Development Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Rebuilding a Flask-based 3D print job management system for an academic/makerspace setting operating as an **extremely small lab with at most two employees working as a duo, often on the same computer using a single, shared password**. The system handles workflow from student submission to completion, with file tracking, staff approval, and the ability to open uploaded files directly in local applications.

**Core Objectives:**
1. **Student submission process**: Upload 3D model files (.stl, .obj, .3mf) with metadata
2. **Staff approval workflow**: Review, slice files, approve/reject jobs  
3. **Enhanced operational dashboard**: Real-time auto-updating interface with audio notifications and visual alerts
4. **File lifecycle management**: Track original files; manage authoritative files post-slicing; embed metadata.json
5. **Job status tracking & Event Logging**: Clear progression through status workflow with immutable event log
6. **Email notifications**: Asynchronously send automated updates to students
7. **Direct file opening**: Custom protocol handler to open local files in slicer software

**Target Environment**: System can run on up to two staff computers, as long as both use the same shared storage and database.

- **Backend**: Modular Flask (Blueprints) with SQLAlchemy (PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS with professional card-style UI, Alpine.js for interactivity  
- **Task Queue**: Celery or RQ for asynchronous processing (emails, thumbnails)
- **Authentication**: Simple staff-wide shared password with session management
- **File Storage**: Shared network storage with standardized naming and status-based directory structure
- **Email**: Flask-Mail with Office 365 SMTP integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Flask-Migrate for schema management
- **Time Display**: Central Time (America/Chicago) with automatic DST handling
- **Pricing**: Weight-based ($0.10/gram filament, $0.20/gram resin, $3.00 minimum)

## Job Lifecycle (Event-Driven)

1. **Uploaded**: Student submits ‚Üí file stored, metadata.json created, thumbnail task queued
2. **Pending**: Staff approves ‚Üí confirmation email sent, awaiting student confirmation
3. **Rejected**: Staff rejects ‚Üí rejection email sent with reasons
4. **ReadyToPrint**: Student confirms ‚Üí file moved to print queue
5. **Printing**: Staff marks as printing ‚Üí job in progress
6. **Completed**: Staff marks complete ‚Üí completion email sent
7. **PaidPickedUp**: Student collects ‚Üí final state

## Lessons

### User Specified Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command

### Implementation Lessons
- V0.dev design system provides excellent professional appearance with consistent color palette
- Database schema validation is critical - runtime tests prevent deployment crises
- Template macro definitions must be properly exported to avoid rendering failures
- Comprehensive testing framework saves significant debugging time
- Emergency recovery phases require systematic approach with clear success criteria
